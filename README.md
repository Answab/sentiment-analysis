#### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion Mining is a branch of data mining where, text data is analyzed for getting emotions, beliefs, and attitudes of the public toward a particular topic, issue, product, or service. It is very helpful in understanding customer behaviour, public emotion towards a social issue, public support for a topic, etc. Here we have used a dataset of Covid-19 related tweets to perform the sentiment analysis task. Using sentiment analysis the social media posts or tweets will be classified into various emotional categories. The basic classification is positive, negative, and neutral.
