# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as Opinion Mining is a branch of data mining where, text data is analyzed for getting emotions, beliefs, and attitudes of the public toward a particular topic, issue, product, or service. It is very helpful in understanding customer behaviour, public emotion towards a social issue, public support for a topic, etc. 
Using sentiment analysis the social media posts or tweets will
 be classified into various emotional categories. The basic classification is
 positive, negative, and neutral.
